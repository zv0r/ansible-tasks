# comment:
#   Defines a default comment or note associated with the mailbox. This
#   value is accessible through the IMAP METADATA mailbox entries
#   "/shared/comment" and "/private/comment". Users with sufficient
#   privileges can override the default value for entries with a custom
#   value.

# NOTE: Assumes "namespace inbox" has been defined in 10-mail.conf.
namespace inbox {
  # These mailboxes are widely used and could perhaps be created automatically:
  mailbox Drafts {
    special_use = \Drafts
    auto = subscribe
  }
  mailbox Junk {
    special_use = \Junk
    auto = subscribe
    autoexpunge = 3d
  }
  mailbox Trash {
    special_use = \Trash
    auto = subscribe
    autoexpunge = 3d
  }

  # For \Sent mailboxes there are two widely used names. We'll mark both of
  # them as \Sent. User typically deletes one of them if duplicates are created.
  mailbox Sent {
    special_use = \Sent
    auto = subscribe
  }

  # If you have a virtual "All messages" mailbox:
  #mailbox virtual/All {
  #  special_use = \All
  #  comment = All my messages
  #}

  # If you have a virtual "Flagged" mailbox:
  #mailbox virtual/Flagged {
  #  special_use = \Flagged
  #  comment = All my flagged messages
  #}

  # If you have a virtual "Important" mailbox:
  #mailbox virtual/Important {
  #  special_use = \Important
  #  comment = All my important messages
  #}
}
